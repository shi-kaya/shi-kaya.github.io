    <ul class = "A">
        <li>Corey likes to play fetch! We have lots and lots of toys for Corey at the house, and he loves to play fetch with every one of them. The first thing he does when we get home 
        is bring us a toy so we can throw it for him to fetch! When the weather is nice, we take him to play fetch outside in our backyard or in the community's common area where there 
        is alot of grass for him to run around in.</li>
        <li>Corey likes to visit the dog park! We try to take him to the dog park near our house when the weather isn't too hot or too cold. He loves the drive there, and always jumps 
        into the car with tons of excitement. Then, he would stick his head out the entirety of the car ride and feel the breeze. When we get to the dog park, he is sometimes shy with 
        the other dogs. But, he loves all the attention from the humans! After a while, he may warm up to some of the dogs and also play with them. </li>
        <li>Corey also loves to run away! Whenever the door is opened, he always tries to wiggle is way out. Sometimes, this becomes very inconvenient. On the day of my junior prom, he 
        had managed to get out of the house! We had to chase him down while it was raining and we were all dressed up. He thinks its a fun game where we case him. Somestimes, when we get
        close to catching him, we would even turn around and wag his tail, taunting us!</li>
    </ul>

     <p id = 'main'> What are some things Corey <b>Dislikes</b>? </p>

   <ul class = "A">
        <li>Corey doesn't like the rain. When its raining and we need to let him out, he finishes his business in a jiffy and drags us back home as soon as he's done. </li>
        <li>Along the same vein, Corey doesn't like the pool or bodies of water, like the ocean. We have taken him to pool parties and beaches several times, and while he doesnt mind 
        getting his toe beans wet, he hates getting in the water and activley runs away from waves. It's pretty cute to see him run twoards the water when the waves are recideding, and 
        then run twoards us when the waves are coming back. </li>
        <li>Corey also hates getting his teeth brushed and his nails trimmed. Every time, it's a two person job with one person holding him and feeding his treats and pets, while the 
        other person is hard at work!</li>
    </ul>
