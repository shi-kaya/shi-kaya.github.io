        <li>Corey is a Welsh Penbroke Corgi, a breed of dog which are known for their short stubby legs and loveable personalities. Corey is five years old, and though his ancestors
        where bred to heard up livestock, Corey would much rather lounge around on a sofa or play fetch. He is now 5 years old, with his birthday being June 30th's 2019. When we first
        got him, he was super small, and I could pick him up in the one hand. Now, he is pretty big for a corgi at around 31 pounds. He used to be almost all black and had green eyes, 
        but overtime his fur turned more golden and white, and his green eyes became more of a hazel color. He is pretty lazy, but very food orientedoriented so will work very hard to use his
        puppy eyes on us while we are eating. At least he's not tall enough to reach the table, or all our food would be gone! Corey being food oriented makes it a little easier for us
        to teach him tricks! So far, he knows his name, sit, stay, spin, snout, paw and down. We live in Pennsylvania but have driven Corey up a few times to see Boston. But, he hasn't 
        been on the Northeastern Campus yet, so that's a must for next time!</li>
